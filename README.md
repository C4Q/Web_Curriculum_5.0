# Pursuit 6.0 Web Curriculum

## Introduction

Welcome to Pursuit's full-stack web development course. This course is constantly in development - think of it as constantly in beta - but we're proud of it and we hope you enjoy. Take a look at the commit history for updates on our development!

## Units

The core curriculum is separated into five units:

* [Fundamentals](./fundamentals/README.md)
* [HTML, CSS, and DOM](./html_css_dom/README.md)
* [Node, Express, and SQL](./node/README.md)
* [React 1](./react/README.md)
* [React 2](./advanced_react/README.md)

Please refrain from reading ahead until you feel as though you've mastered all concepts in a section.
