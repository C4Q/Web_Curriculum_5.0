## Lesson

So far, our programs have been running line-by-line, from top to bottom. Conditionals allow us to execute some lines of code in some cases, but not in others.

### The `if` statement

#### Only `if`

Our first conditional is the `if` statement. It executes a block of code only when an expression (provided in parentheses) evaluates to a _truthy_ value. A block of code is any number of lines enclosed with curly brackets: `{...}`.

The simplest `if` statement is the one where we simply provide the value `true`:

```js
if (true) {
  console.log("It is true");
}
```

The value `true` above can be substituted with any expression that evaluates to `true`, such as `'cat' === 'cat'` and `2 > 1`.
The code block will also run if the conditional can evaluate to a truthy value such as:

```js
// this will log 'hello' to the console.
if (1) {
  console.log("hello");
}
```

The next simplest `if` statement is the one that is always false.

```js
if (false) {
  console.log("hello");
}
```

The code block following the `if` statement will **never** be executed.

This is also true for expressions that evaluate to _falsy_ such as:

```js
// this will not log anything to the console.
if (0) {
  console.log("hello");
}
```

> Provide other examples of expressions for the condition to an `if` statement
> so that the code block following it will never be executed.

Note that an an `if` statement is not the end of a program. The code following it will run as usual.

```js
let num = 4;
if (num > 2) {
  console.log("It's larger than 2");
}
console.log("done checking");
```

In the code above, `'Its larger than 2'` may or may not be printed (depending on the value of `num`). Either way `'done checking'` _will_ be printed.

#### if - else

We can extend the `if` statement to make it an `if - else` statement. This statement will execute one of two code blocks:

```js
let num = 3;
if (num > 2) {
  console.log("it's larger than 2");
} else {
  console.log("it's not large than 2");
}
```

If the condition evaluates to a truthy value, the first block will be executed. If it evaluated to a falsy value, the second block will be executed.
We can think of an `if` statement like choosing one of two detours:

> Write three `if - else` statements in which the **second** block of code will always be executed.

#### if - else if - else

We can use the `if - else if - else` statement when we want one of three or more code blocks to be executed.
We will have the initial `if`, followed by any number of `else if`s, optionally followed by an `else`.

```js
var color = "azure";

if (color === "blue") {
  console.log("That's my favorite color!");
} else if (color === "green") {
  console.log("That's a nice color!");
} else {
  console.log("That's an okay color.");
}

console.log("done checking");
```

The above statement will check the conditions one at a time. First, the conditional statement following `if` will be checked.
If it is falsy, the conditional statement following `else if` will be checked. If it is also falsy, the code block following `else` will be executed.
We can have as many `else if` statements as we like. For example, we may want to check if a number is equal to `1`, `2` or `3`:

```js
let num = 2;
if (num === 1) {
  console.log("Jackpot!");
} else if (num === 2) {
  console.log("You won 10 coins");
} else if (num === 3) {
  console.log("You won 20 coins");
} else {
  console.log("Try again.");
}
```

Remember, only **one** of the code blocks will be executed.

### Checking for range

One way we can utilize `if - else if - else` statements is to check for different ranges.
For example, we may want to perform a different action depending on the user's age group.

```js
let userAge = 19;

if (userAge < 18) {
  console.log("Parental supervision is required");
} else if (userAge < 21) {
  console.log("Parental permission is required");
} else {
  console.log("You may proceed");
}
```

> What are the ranges that the code above is checking for? How can we rewrite the statement with the **larger than** (`>`) operator?

### Using logical operators

So far in our `if ...` statements we have been checking for a single condition. It is also possible to check for multiple conditions using the `&&` and `||` boolean operators.
For example, we may want to perform the same action when the day is Saturday or Sunday.

```js
let day = "Monday";

if (day === "Saturday" || day === "Sunday") {
  console.log("Have a nice weekend!");
} else if (day === "Friday") {
  console.log("The weekend is almost here!");
} else {
  console.log("Have a nice day.");
}
```

We can use the && operator to check for ranges. For example, say we want to check if a user's age is between 18-45.
This is how we will express this in JavaScript: if age is larger than 18 **AND** age is smaller than 45,
then {...}. In JavaScript, the opening curly bracket stands in place of the word `then`, and the closing one stand in place of the period at the end of the sentence.

```js
let userAge = 27;

if (userAge > 18 && userAge < 45) {
  console.log("would you like to take a survey?");
}
```

> How would you write a conditional statement that outputs the same message if a user's age is either smaller than 18 **OR** larger than 45?

## The Ternary Operator

```js
conditional ? true : false;
```

The ternary operator is made up of three parts: The first part to the left of the question mark is a conditional. The second part right after the
question mark is the value returned if the conditional is truthy. The final part is value returned if the condition is falsey.

```js
> 1 === 1 ? 1 : 2
// => 1
> 1 === 2 ? 1 : 2
// => 2
```

> Try it yourself! Experiment with different conditionals and outcomes.

## Switch Statements

Switch statemes evaluate similarly to `if - else if - else` statements. They take in an expression and, depending on the value of
that expression, run a specific code block.

The **break** keyword allows us to break out of the switch statement.

The **default** keyword works similarly to the 'else' in regular conditionals. If the expression does not match any of the cases,
the default code block will run.

```js
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
  // code block
}
```
